## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jameschapman19/Template
    cd Template
```

2. Install dependencies using your preferred package manager:


```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn
    # or
    pnpm install
    # or
    bun install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    # or

```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the pages by modifying the .tsx files in the pages directory. The pages auto-update as you edit the files.

This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
